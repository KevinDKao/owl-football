# NFL Draft Model Comparison Summary

This directory contains comparison results and visualizations for different machine learning models used to predict NFL draft outcomes. These models analyze college football player performance data to predict whether a player will be drafted and potentially their draft position.

## üîç Key Findings

### Feature Importance

Based on the feature importance data:

1. **Player Weight** is the most important predictor across all models:
   - Random Forest: ~74.6% importance (with ratings), ~83.5% (without ratings)
   - XGBoost: ~48.6% importance (with ratings), ~32.6% (without ratings)

2. **Pre-Draft Grades/Rankings** are highly significant when included:
   - Pre-Draft Grade: ~16.8% importance in Random Forest, ~11.2% in XGBoost
   - Pre-Draft Ranking and Position Ranking are also important factors

3. **Physical Attributes** matter:
   - Height is consistently important, especially in models without ratings
   - More significant in XGBoost (~7.9% with ratings, ~9.0% without) than Random Forest

4. **Performance Statistics** that show importance:
   - Defensive metrics: Tackles (Total and Solo), TFL, Sacks, QB Hurries
   - Receiving metrics: YPR (Yards Per Reception), YDS (Yards), Receptions
   - Rushing metrics: YPC (Yards Per Carry), Total Yards
   - Passing metrics: More significant in XGBoost models

### Model Comparison

The models evaluated include:
- Random Forest (with and without pre-draft ratings)
- XGBoost (with and without pre-draft ratings)
- AutoGluon (results included in metrics comparison)

Models using pre-draft ratings generally outperform those without ratings, but the gap is smaller than expected, suggesting these models can still be valuable for early scouting when ratings aren't yet available.
